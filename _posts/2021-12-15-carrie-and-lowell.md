# Sufjan Stevens
Sufjan Stevens is an American indie singer songwriter. His discography ranges from lo-fi folk music and experimental electronica. He and his stepfather Lowell Brams co-founded the indie music lable Asthmatic Kitty.

# Carrie & Lowell
Carrie & Lowell is Sufjan's seventh studio album. It is a return to his folk roots after experimental projects like the Age of Adz. It is an album that has occupied, and will continue to occupy a special place in my heart because it was the album that introduced me to the indie scene. The unmatched candor and underlying sorrow that Sufjan developed in the narrative of Carrie & Lowell changed my life. I remember looping over the album in sleepless nights, crying ugly tears. It is the most cathartic music I have heard in my life. The instrumentation sounds deceivingly easy (actually not easy at all). The simplicity creates a vast and hollowing effect, introducing the listener to a meditative space where they are presented with the most pivotal moments and emotions in Sufjan's life.

The album is written in memory of Carrie, Sufjan's mother, who passed away in 2012 due to stomach cancer. Suffering from depression, schizophrenia and alcoholism, she had remarried many times, and repeatedly abandoned Sufjan and his siblings. When Sufjan was little, Carrie married Lowell, Sufjan's stepfather. The brief marriage gave Sufjan some of his best Childhood memories. In __Eugene__, he sings __"Lights struck from the lemon tree / What if I've never seen / hysterical lights from Eugene?"__ Sufjan frankly expresses longing for his mother and the agony caused by her abandonment in many of the songs in the track list. In __The Only Thing__, for example, __"Should I tear my heart out now? / Everything I feel returns to you somehow."__ The death of Carrie, after years after years of unexpressed affection and sadness, is the inspiration and emotional centerpiece of the album. __"Should've wrote a letter / Express how I felt / The empty feeling"__ Sufjan talked about the regret he felt in __Should Have Known Better__.

The ultimate goal of the album is not just to mourn Carrie, or to expose the hidden skeleton in the closet, but to describe the sudden change of perspective that sometimes happen with a loved one's passage. As Sufjan himself said in his interview with Pitchfork: "With this record, I needed to extract myself out of this environment of make-believe. It’s something that was necessary for me to do in the wake of my mother’s death—to pursue a sense of peace and serenity in spite of suffering. It’s not really trying to say anything new, or prove anything, or innovate. It feels artless, which is a good thing. This is not my art project; this is my life." The themes of the record spans courage and depression, faith and doubts, love and loneliness...

Sufjan identifies as Christian, but he does not shy away from discussing his periods of doubts. In __Drawn to the Blood__, he asks god, imploringly, __"For my prayers has always been love / What did I do to deserve this?"__ The struggle is made even more apparent in __No Shade in the Shadows of the Cross__, which as the title suggests, is about how his piety fails to lift him up in dire times. In addition to biblical references, Sufjan also frequently conjures imagery from Greek Mythology, possibly due to his Greek and Lithuanian lineage. The mixing of anecdotes and myths facilitates the world building process, and show us the many facets of Sufjan's inner life within a few lines of the lyrics.

One thing that I think the album does but not enough: the vulnerable moments, when the art is stripped away to reveal the raw tragedy and immense heroism in dealing with them. It could be argued that the entire album is intimate, but notice that Sufjan seldom directly expresses his sorrow, but instead incline to work with metaphors. The album is the most effective at its most vulnerable moments. I will provide some excerpts below. If you are ever in need of a good cry, give these a listen.

#Lyric Excerpts
**Should have Known Better**
I should have known better\
To see what I could see\
My black shroud\
Holding down my feelings\
A pillar for my enemies\
\
I should have wrote a letter\
And grieve what I happen to grieve\
My black shroud\
I never trust my feelings\
I waited for the remedy\
\
When I was three, three maybe four\
She left us at that video store\
Be my rest, be my fantasy\
\
I’m light as a feather\
I’m bright as the Oregon breeze\
My black shroud\
Frightened by my feelings\
I only wanna be a relief\
\
No, I’m not a go-getter\
The demon had a spell on me\
My black shroud\
Captain of my feelings\
The only thing I wanna believe\
\
When I was three, and free to explore\
I saw her face on the back of the door\
Be my rest, be my fantasy\
\
I should have known better\
Nothing can be changed\
The past is still the past\
The bridge to nowhere\
I should have wrote a letter\
Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling\
\
Don’t back down, concentrate on seeing\
The breakers in the bar, the neighbor’s greeting\
My brother had a daughter\
The beauty that she brings, illumination\
\
Don’t back down, there is nothing left\
The breakers in the bar, no reason to live\
I’m a fool in the fetter\
Rose of Aaron’s beard, where you can reach me\
\
Don’t back down: nothing can be changed\
Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor\
My brother had a daughter\
The beauty that she brings, illumination\
